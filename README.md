# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Australia

**Predicting long-term climate trends across Australia using data analytics and machine learning.**

This project analyzes historical and projected datasets (temperature, rainfall, aridity, NDVI) to model **future environmental and climate patterns** in Australia.  
By combining Python-based analytics and climate data, it aims to understand **desertification risks, heat trends, and regional climate variability** over the next decades.
